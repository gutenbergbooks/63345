        <h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
        <p class="pfirst"><span>This little book has been brought forward in order to supply the demand for a systematic elementary course in the principles of wireless telegraph apparatus and the electrical laws upon which it depends.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Many operators, both amateur and professional, although perfectly well able to send and receive messages, do not thoroughly understand the rudimentary theory of the instruments.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It is readily realizable that it is quite impossible to enter into all the engineering details in a book of this size, but at the same time it has been possible to present a very comprehensive treatise of the subject and embody sufficient material to give a thorough grounding in the subject.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>In order to avoid repetition and confusion and to make each instrument or principle which has been discussed stand distinctly by itself, the text has been divided into separate lessons following in their arrangement, as far as has been possible, the logical sequence.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>For the same reason, and also because of lack of space all details pertaining to the actual maintenance and adjustment of the instruments has been embodied in another book called "The Operation of Wireless Telegraph Apparatus."</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><strong class="bold">Natural Magnets. Artificial Magnets. Magnetic Field of Force.</strong></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>It was known to the ancients that certain hard, black stones, an iron ore consisting of iron and oxygen found notably at Magnesia in Asia Minor, possessed the power of attracting small pieces of iron or steel. This almost magic attribute of the stone was early turned to account in navigation and secured for it the name of Lodestone (leading-stone) because of its remarkable property of pointing north and south when suspended by a thread. The name of magnet (magnes lapis) was also given to these stones.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><em class="italics">Magnetism</em> <span>is the peculiar property occassionally possessed by certain bodies (more especially by iron and steel) whereby they attract or repel one another.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>If a piece of hard iron or steel be rubbed with a lodestone it will be found to have also acquired the properties of the stone. If hung up by a thread it will point north and south, will attract light bits of iron and if dipped into iron filings will cause the latter to cling in two small tufts near the ends with few, if any, near the middle.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>This indicates that the attractive power of the magnet is concentrated in two opposite parts. These parts are called the</span> <em class="italics">Poles</em><span>. The line joining the poles is the</span> <em class="italics">Magnetic Axis</em><span>.</span></p>

The field of force in the neighborhood of a magnet grows weaker as the distance from the magnet increases.

It will be found that the wire W becomes heated. If the copper and zinc are connected to a galvanometer it will show the presence of an electric current passing through the circuit. The cell may be considered as a sort of chemical furnace in which fuel is burned to drive the current. The zinc is the fuel. The copper is merely present to "pick up" the current and takes no part chemically.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>If a number of such simple cells are properly united, the zinc of one being joined to the copper of the next and so on, a</span> <em class="italics">battery</em> <span>is formed. The current flows from the copper, called the</span> <em class="italics">positive</em> <span>pole, through the wires (when they are joined) to the zinc or negative pole and back to the copper through the solution.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The electricity generated by the cells exerts a certain pressure or tendency to pass through the wires. This tendency is called the</span> <em class="italics">potential</em><span>. The potential is measured in volts. The potential (also called the electromotive force) in the case of the Voltaic Cell just described is 1.07 volts. If the copper strip is replaced with one of graphite or carbon, the voltage will rise to 1.73 volts.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>After a cell has been in action for a short time, the positive plate (copper or carbon, as the case may be) becomes covered with a film of hydrogen. The cell is then said to be</span> <em class="italics">polarized</em><span>. The film of gas bubbles partially shields the plate from contact with the liquid. When the plate becomes in this condition, the current is much feebler than when it is clear.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The most effective way of removing the hydrogen is to add some chemical to the sulphuric acid solution which will combine chemically with the hydrogen as soon as it appears.

        <p class="pnext"><span>One of the best known forms of cell is the dry cell. It consists of an outer shell of zinc forming the negative electrode and a central rod of carbon as the positive. The active agent of the cell is a paste composed principally of sal ammoniac lining the interior of the zinc shell. The depolarizing agent of the cell is manganese dioxide mixed with crushed carbon and packed tightly around the carbon rod. The cell is not as its name implies perfectly dry inside, but the chemicals are in paste form. The cell is sealed at the top by a bituminous compound making the cell air tight and portable. Dry cells are only successful for intermittent work, that is, where they are not required to deliver a heavy current continuously. They deteriorate after long standing because the moisture evaporates. Dry cells, however, are a very convenient source of current where the demand is not too great and portability is desired.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>In the second illustration the pipe leading from the tank is much larger than that from the first and consequently the amperage or volume flowing is greater in comparison. From this it may be readily seen that every circuit through which a current is flowing must exhibit both quantities.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The unit of electrical work or energy is the</span> <em class="italics">Watt</em><span>. Seven hundred and forty-six watts constitute an electrical horse-power. The number of watts is indicated by the voltage times the amperage.

        <p class="pnext"><span>The discovery of the induction of currents in wires by moving them across a magnetic field led to the construction of electrical machines, called dynamos, to generate current in place of batteries.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The dynamo is perhaps the most important piece of electrical apparatus there is for it is the source of ninety-nine percent of all the electricity now in use. It is practically necessary in any case where a considerable quantity of electricity is used to have a dynamo on the spot or else bring the currents over a wire from some supply station where dynamos are kept running.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The operation of a dynamo is dependent upon current induction. It contains a system of closed conductors revolving in a magnetic field in such a way as to continuously vary the number of lines of force threading among them.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>The illustration show's the ideal simple dynamo, which consists of a loop of wire arranged to revolve between the poles of a permanent magnet in the direction of the arrow and around a horizontal line as an axis. The lines of magnetic force (represented by the fine straight lines) pass across from N to S as indicated. When in the position shown, the coil of wire encloses the largest possible number of lines of magnetic force. When it has revolved ninety degrees or a quarter of a turn as shown by the dotted lines, the lines of force will be parallel to the plane of the coil and none will pass through. During this quarter of the turn the number of lines of force has been decreasing. During the next quarter of a turn the lines will increase again, but will this time pass through from the opposite side of the loop. This decrease and increase of the number of lines of force passing through the loop generates therein a current of electricity. The same process is repeated during the next half of a revolution. However, since the lines of force flow through from opposite sides of the coil every half revolution, the current reverses twice during the same period.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>In the illustration the loop is represented as forming a complete closed circuit in itself. In order to draw any current for external use some method of establishing connection to the terminals of the coil must be had. This is furnished by two circular rings called</span> <em class="italics">collector rings</em><span>. The little strips of metal or carbon employed to form contact with the rings are called brushes.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>The Induction Coil is an apparatus for producing currents of a very high electromotive force. It consists of a helix of large, insulated wire surrounding an iron core, and this again surrounded by a second coil consisting of many thousand turns of very fine wire carefully insulated. The inner or primary coil is connected in series with a battery, the circuit also including a device called an</span> <em class="italics">interrupter</em><span>. The object of the interrupter is to make and break the primary circuit in rapid succession. Every time the current is turned on in the primary circuit, the primary coil creates a magnetic field which induces a current in the secondary in accordance with the laws of induction.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>Likewise at every "break" in the circuit caused by the interrupter, the lines of force disappear and a second current impulse is induced in the</span> <em class="italics">secondary</em> <span>coil. As the number of lines of magnetic force created and destroyed at each make and break is the same, the two electromotive impulses in the secondary are equal. By adding a</span> <em class="italics">condenser</em><span>, however, the current at "make" is caused to take a considerable fraction of time to grow, while at "break" the cessation is instantaneous in comparison. The rate of "cutting" of the lines of force is very much more rapid at "break" than at "make" therefore. The currents at "break" manifest themselves as a brilliant torrent of sparks between the ends of the secondary wires when they are brought near enough together.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The central iron core around which the coils are wound is for the purpose of increasing or concentrating the number of lines of force that pass through the coils. Magnetic lines flow more easily through iron than through air and so prefer that path. It is made up of a bundle of fine iron wires in order to avoid induced currents which would be set up in the iron were it a solid mass and so retard its rapidity of magnetization or demagnetization as to hamper the efficiency of the coil.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Wireless Telegraphy as practiced to-day is merely a method of setting up electromagnetic waves in the ether and then detecting their existence at a distant point. It may be divided into four distinct and individual operations, namely:</span></p>
        <ol class="arabic simple">
          <li>
            <p class="first pfirst"><span>The generation of electrical oscillations.</span></p>

          <li>
            <p class="first pfirst"><span>The detection of the electrical oscillations.</span></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="pfirst"><span>We have already learned how electrical oscillations may be generated by the discharge of a Leyden jar or a condenser. In order to perform the first two operations named above, it is therefore merely necessary to arrange a condenser in such a way that it is most effective.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The induction coil or transformer is employed to charge the condenser because the currents of these instruments are much more powerful than those of a static electric machine. The induction coil is connected to a set of batteries and a key so that the periods during which the current is on and off may be controlled at will by the pressure of the fingers.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>The secondary of the coil is connected to a battery of Leyden jars or a condenser. The fact was mentioned above that a certain amount of inductance in the circuit is necessary for the production of electrical oscillations This is furnished, or at least the greater part, by a device called a helix which consists of a coil of heavy wire wound around a suitable framework.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The spark discharge takes place across a device called a spark gap.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>When the key is pressed, the high potential currents of the induction coil charge the Leyden jar or condenser and cause it to discharge through the helix and across the spark gap. High frequency oscillations are immediately created in this part of the circuit. The spark gap, condenser and that part of the helix included, constitute the closed circuit. The electromagnetic waves thrown off by such an oscillatory system would not be very far reaching in their effects because the disturbances would be confined to the immediate neighborhood of the apparatus, so recourse is had to the aerial and ground. The aerial consists of a network of wires elevated high in the air. The ground or earth connection is simply a large metal plate buried in moist earth or thrown into the sea. By connecting the aerial and ground to the helix in the manner shown in Fig. 27, the high frequency currents are caused to surge up and down the aerial system into the ground and create very powerful electromagnetic waves which possess the power of exciting electrical oscillations in another aerial even though it may be located many miles away.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The existence of these oscillations is made known to the receiving operator by a device known as a detector, described fully in one of the following lessons.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>The aerial system or antenna might be termed the mouth and ear of the wireless station, for it is this huge network of wires stretching high into the air that emits or intercepts the electromagnetic waves upon which such systems of communication depend.</span></p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The value of an aerial is dependent upon its height above the surface of the earth. The greater its height the wider will be the field of force or strain set up in its neighborhood and consequently more powerful electric waves will be developed. Proximity to all large conductors, such as smokestacks, telephone lines, etc., is always avoided because these obstacles would absorb appreciable amounts of the energy sent out from the station and also shield it somewhat from the incoming waves. Aerials are usually constructed of conductors made up of a number of wires stranded together. High frequency currents only travel near the surface of conductors and stranded wires consequently offer less resistance because they possess more surface than a solid conductor of equal cross section.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The aerial is always carefully insulated by means of special high tension insulators, made of insulating composition molded into a corrugated bar having iron rings embedded in each end to which the wires may be fastened.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Aerials take many different forms, but may be classified into two general groups called the vertical aerials and flat top aerials.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Vertical aerials compose the</span> <em class="italics">grid</em><span>,</span> <em class="italics">fan</em><span>,</span> <em class="italics">cage</em> <span>and</span> <em class="italics">umbrella</em> <span>forms.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Flat top aerials are known as the</span> <em class="italics">T</em><span>,</span> <em class="italics">inverted U</em><span>,</span> <em class="italics">L</em> <span>and</span> <em class="italics">V</em> <span>types, according to their shape.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Pyramid Aerial is only employed in ultra-powerful stations and is becoming an obsolete form.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Fan Aerial is a good type of especial value in crowded quarters.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Grid Aerial is probably the best form of vertical aerial, but is gradually giving way to those of the flat top class.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Cage Aerial is rarely used nowadays and may be considered obsolete.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Umbrella Aerial is a very good type now being employed in many high power stations. A metallic pole or mast insulated at the base used to support the wires, so that it is part of the aerial itself.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The "T" Aerial is the most nearly perfect and gives the best "all around" results.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The "L" or Horizontal type of aerial is used wherever it is desirable for any reason to send the most powerful waves in one direction.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The "V" type is used where the highest point must be near the station.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The wire leading into the station, from the aerial is called the "rat-tail" or "lead-in." It is always very carefully insulated and usually enters the station through a hole in the window or wall by means of a "window pane bushing" or "leading-in insulator."</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Certain aerials possess a directive action, that is they radiate and receive messages in some directions better than others. Flat top aerials possess this peculiarity more noticeably than the vertical types. Flat top aerials receive and radiate waves coming from and going towards a direction opposite to that in which the free end points.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>Certain aerial forms may be classed as loop and straightaway accordingly as they are connected and led into the station. In the straightaway form of antenna, the wires are connected together as a whole and one rat-tail led into the station. In the loop form the wires are all connected together and divided into two sections. Two wires are led into the station.</span></p>

When a strong electric current is passed through the acid electrolyte, the current is very rapidly interrupted by the formation of gases on the small platinum electrode.

        <p class="pnext"><span>The electrodes are usually provided with flanges or radiators which tend to dissipate the heat and keep them cool. If the electrodes should become very hot the spark would arc, that is, pass across the gap without generating any electrical oscillations. Spark gap electrodes are usually flat or else hollow on the sparking surface.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The proper adjustment of the gap, i.e., the distance between the electrodes is a matter of the utmost importance for there is a point just where the maximum amount of energy will be radiated.</span></p>

When the aerial is struck by a wave, the feeble alternating currents break down the bubbles and permit the currents to flow, causing a sound in the telephone receivers.</span></p>

The platinum wire is connected to a spindle carrying a pointer in such a manner that when the heat causes the wire to expand the expansion is conveyed to the spindle and the pointer moves over the scale magnifying the motion.

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Practically every radio circuit includes an adjustable inductance of some sort, usually consisting of a layer of wire wound over a tube and arranged so that the amount of wire in the circuit can be varied by means of a switch, a plug or a slider. These methods of variation are familiar in the ordinary tuning coil, loose coupler, loading coil, etc.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p class="pnext"><span>If the plug, switch or sliding contact, depending upon the method of variation employed, is at E as in Fig. 60 so that only the portion of the coil A E B is in the circuit, then the portion E F together with A E may form an oscillator which, in order for the reader to obtain a better conception, may be likened to a sort of secondary winding, with A E considered as the primary. The oscillations of this part of the system may produce some very undesirable disturbances, especially so when the frequency of the currents in the circuit A E bear a certain relation to the natural frequency of the oscillator or E F. The losses due to the disturbance of these undesirable oscillations and also those resulting from eddy currents induced in the free portion or oscillator E F by the magnetic flux of A E are known as "dead-end effects."</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>These losses are very much more noticeable in receiving circuits than in transmitters on account of the very weak currents in the former and the importance of preserving all the energy when it is already very small.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Dead end losses take place principally in receiving transformers, loading coils and tuning coils. The losses are much more marked on short waves than long waves.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The presence of these highly objectionable losses, and they are large enough to not only seriously decrease the strength of signals but also to make selective tuning impossible, may be avoided by only using coils which are just the right size so that they can be entirely included in the circuit.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>This is a very easy matter when only one wave length or at the most, two or three wave lengths are to be received, because it is then easily possible to quickly connect the coil of the proper size in the circuit. It is desirable however in most stations, and especially so in amateur stations that the apparatus be universal so as to be quickly and easily tunable to any wave length within its range.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Many amateurs build large loose couplers having a very wide wave length range under the impression that they have an ideal instrument. The truth of the matter is however that such an arrangement is decidedly inefficient especially on the shorter waves when only a portion of the windings are in circuit and there is a large dead end portion.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The better types of receiving transformers are now provided with "no dead end loss switches" which automatically break the windings up into a number of groups so that only that portion which is actually required to tune the circuit to a certain wave length is in circuit and the remainder of the coil is entirely disconnected.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>These switches are located at certain definite points as previously determined by measurements of the coil with the aid of a wave meter.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>The diagram in Fig. 61 illustrates the principle of such an arrangement. The points marked 1, 2 and 3 are the places in the coil where the switches are located so as to divide the winding up into separate parts. Suppose that it is necessary to move the slider or switch to such a point on the coil as represented by its position in the illustration marked E. The switch located at 1 would then automatically close as the slider or switch moved past 2 and 3 would however still remain open because that part of the winding which they connect would not be required. If it became necessary to include more of the winding in the circuit, 2 and 3 would automatically close as the slider or switch was moved along the coil and open again as it was moved back.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The automatic arrangement of the switches is easily accomplished in a number of different manners by means of levers, cams, trips, or some other mechanical means.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Every coil of wire possesses the property, not only of carrying a current of electricity but of</span> <em class="italics">holding a charge</em> <span>of electricity as well. This property is called capacity. The</span> <em class="italics">capacity</em> <span>of a condenser is its property for holding a charge of electricity. The capacity of a coil is termed its "distributed capacity" in order to distinguish it from the capacity of a condenser. The distributed capacity of a coil is due to the condenser effect which exists between the adjacent turns of the wire. The effect of this distributed condenser is exactly the same as if a small condenser was connected across the ends of the coil as shown in the accompanying illustration.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Distributed capacity is very objectionable in most receiving circuits because a radio detector depends upon voltage for its operation and when a circuit contains an appreciable amount of distributed capacity the voltage is considerably lower than it would be otherwise.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The usual method of reducing the distributed capacity of a coil is to use wire having comparatively thick insulation so that the wires are spaced farther apart. Certain shellacs and varnishes used in impregnated windings increase the specific dielectric capacity of the space between the turns and increase the distributed capacity of the winding.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The same objection to distributed capacity also holds good in the case of what might be termed capacity losses which are due to improperly arranged connections, contact points, etc. Every pair of leads or taps from a coil possesses capacity. They really form a miniature condenser, the wires corresponding to the tinfoil or metal sheets of the condenser and the air between being the dielectric.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>For that reason the leads should always be as far apart from one another as possible and contact points should be as small as possible. It is unwise to use "double conductor" having two parallel conductors bound together for leading out connections or connecting radio apparatus.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>If capacity losses and distributed capacity are reduced to a minimum in a circuit, it is possible to employ more inductance than would be otherwise in order to tune the circuit to a certain frequency and the voltage is thereby preserved and full benefit derived therefrom by the changes which it produces in the detector.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>A radio transmitter whose waves are generated by undamped oscillations has many advantages over the ordinary spark transmitter, the oscillations of which are necessarily damped.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The efficiency of an undamped wave transmitter is far greater in almost every respect. The selectivity at a receiving station listening to undamped wave signals is very marked in comparison to that when spark signals are received.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p class="pnext"><span>An arrangement by which such oscillatory currents may be produced is shown in its simplest form in Fig. 62. It consists of an arc, around which is shunted a condenser in series with an inductance. The arc is connected to a source of direct current, preferably having an E. M. F. of 500 volts or more.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The positive electrode of the arc is copper, kept cool by circulating water through a hollow interior or a water jacket. The gap in itself is enclosed in a chamber filled with hydrogen gas or a gas containing hydrogen. The arcs in practical use for generating undamped oscillations are arranged so that they operate in a strong magnetic field. The carbon electrode is constructed so that it is slowly revolved by a small electric motor.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The hydrogen gas atmosphere in which the arc is enclosed is produced by a small feed cup, similar to the ordinary lubricating oil cup, located over the case and filled with alcohol which continuously drips into the flame chamber, where it is vaporized by the heat.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Arc transmitters of large capacity are not as expensive or as bulky as spark transmitters of equal power. The difficulties of handling and controlling a large amount of power in connection with a transmitter of this sort are also not as great as in the case of a spark transmitter. The condenser used with an arc is not nearly so large as that required for a spark transmitter of equal capacity and the voltage of the current is much lower. Condenser breakdown, leakage and insulation problems are therefore not as great.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>For telegraphing with damped transmitters, a key which alternately makes and breaks the primary circuit is sufficient. This is not possible, however, with an arc. The distance between the arc electrodes is usually greater than the gap length which the dynamo voltage would jump and form an arc whenever the key should be closed. It is therefore usual to arrange a key or relay so that it short circuits a portion of the aerial inductance or helix when closed. This short circuit is sufficient to throw the circuit out of tune so that it cannot be heard at the receiving station without readjusting the instruments.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Poulsen arc may be used for radio telephony. A telephone receiver is arranged so as to vary the currents and impress the vibrations of the voice upon the oscillations set up by the arc.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>A decided difference is encountered between damped and undamped oscillations when receiving signals. The ordinary detector cannot be used for receiving undamped oscillations without first being properly modified.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>When telegraphing the dots and dashes of the code by undamped oscillations the change taking place in the detector circuit would merely move the telephone receiver diaphragm from its normal position at the beginning of each dot or dash, causing a click to be heard and nothing more. The telephone receiver diaphragm would remain in a fixed position just as long as the waves from the transmitter kept coming in during each signal. Both dots and dashes would be heard simply as clicks and not appear distinguishable from one another.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The most common and perhaps also the best method is to employ a device called a "ticker" in place of the detector for receiving undamped oscillations.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>This arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 63. The left hand part of the illustration is the circuit diagram. A detail of the "ticker" wheel is shown at the right.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The condenser F C is of comparatively large capacity and is fixed. The condenser C is also fixed but is of much smaller capacity.

        <p class="pnext"><span>When the wheel is revolving at high speed, the wire does not make perfect contact at all points but tends to vibrate and to act as the equivalent of a very high speed interrupter by rapidly opening and closing the circuit.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The basic idea in employing a device and a circuit of this sort in receiving undamped waves is as follows:</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>When the contact is broken at the ticker wheel and the condenser F C is disconnected from the oscillating circuit formed by the condenser C and the secondary of the receiving transformer, the condenser C accumulates a relatively large amount of energy.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Then when the ticker connects the condenser F C in parallel with C, F C takes the major part of the stored energy and discharges it through the telephones P, causing a click to be heard in the latter.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The interruptions of the "ticker" are very rapid, a great many taking place during the duration of a dot or a dash, so that the resultant clicks occur very close together and the dots and dashes sound very similar to the spark signals of a transmitter sending forth damped waves.</span></p>

Amplifiers having two and three bulbs, respectively known as "two step" and "three step" amplifiers give much greater amplification than a one step amplifier and are often used.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>"Hook-ups" or circuit diagrams showing the manner of connecting various instruments are well worth considerable study if one is desirous of securing the greatest selectivity and distance from his apparatus.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>There are almost an endless number of ways and combinations of ways of connecting apparatus, and strange to say, different people seem to be able to secure the best results with widely different methods. In spite of the fact that circuits of this kind are very numerous they can all be reduced to a few fundamental forms and an understanding of these forms will enable a person to devise his own "hook-ups" at will.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Transmitting circuits are fundamentally almost the same. The only real difference in arrangement is made by interchanging the condenser and spark gap. Either one may be placed across the terminals of the induction coil or transformer. There is no difference in the results.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>Consider the circuit shown in the accompanying illustration. The action of the transformer is to charge the condenser to such a point that the voltage is sufficient to leap the spark gap and cause a discharge. The rush of current which is oscillatory takes place through the condenser, spark gap and</span> <em class="italics">primary</em> <span>turns of the helix, or in other words through the</span> <em class="italics">closed</em> <span>circuits. The</span> <em class="italics">secondary</em> <span>turns of the helix, which are those forming part of the aerial circuit, are larger in number than those of the primary, and because of this ratio cause currents of higher voltage than those of the condenser to be impressed upon the aerial system. The currents in the aerial system surge up and down the aerial through the helix into the ground.</span></p>

        <p class="pnext"><span>A shows a simple receiving circuit wherein a single slide tuning coil is connected to a detector. The high frequency currents generated in the aerial surge up and down the system and pass through the detector on their way to the ground. By moving the slider back and forth the electrical length of the circuit may be varied to suit the length of the incoming waves. Oscillations may be</span> <em class="italics">forced</em> <span>upon such a circuit, that is, if the waves are very powerful they will pass through the system and effect the detector no matter whether the slider is adjusted to suit them or not. This would cause interference and confusion in case more than one station were operating at a time.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>By adding a second slider and a condenser as shown in B, this may be avoided to a considerable extent, for slider No. 1 may be adjusted to the desired signals and slider No. 2 placed in a position such as will give the branch of the circuit from the aerial, through the coil and into the ground of which it is a part, a period suited to the objectionable wave and so</span> <em class="italics">carry off</em> <span>the latter into the ground without effecting the detector. The desired signals will pass into the ground through the other branch of the circuit and operate the detector which lies in their path. The selectivity of the outfit may be further increased by the addition of a variable condenser.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>A variable condenser may be placed in one or more of a great many positions. The accompanying illustrations show several. The effect of a condenser placed in series with the ground or aerial is just the opposite of that of a loading coil. It decreases the period and shortens the wave length to which it is adapted.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>This is the age of electricity. The most fascinating of all books for a boy must therefore be one dealing with the mystery of this ancient force and modern wonder, even a mere list of whose services is impossible. The best qualified of experts to instruct boys, Alfred P. Morgan, has in a book far superior to any other of its kind told not only how to make all kinds of motors, telegraphs, telephones, batteries, etc., and to do so economically, but has explained the principles upon which these depend for operation, and how the same thing is done in the every-day world be well presented and so attractive is this really great book that it will be an education for any bright boy to have it, as well as the best kind of a moral safeguard, by leaving no time or thought for evil, and a means of future benefit beyond the power of any one to reckon. Glancing over the pages of this book, one cannot but be impressed by the excellent illustrations, clearness of expression and the large number of subjects that are covered. It is beyond doubt the best book in this line that has ever been written or published. It is a book that will delight every boy who has a leaning towards electrical experiments. The author writes in a clear and chatty style and while he has a thorough technical knowledge of his subject he has succeeded in treating it in a simple manner so that it is readily intelligible to his young readers.</span></p>

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit</span> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

        <p class="pfirst"><span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</span></p>
        <p class="pnext"><span>Corrected</span> <em class="italics">editions</em> <span>of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.</span> <em class="italics">Versions</em> <span>based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</span></p>
